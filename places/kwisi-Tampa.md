## Tampa, FL

### Fun Facts
- Pirates, everywhere.  We have a yearly event called 'Gasparilla,' which is basically pirate Mardi Gras.

### Places to Eat
- Bern's Steakhouse (I'm going there tonight, everyone should be jealous)

### Places to Go
- Busch Gardens - just got a new roller coaster this year

### Places to Avoid
- Town and Country (although I drive through it every day).  People originally from here call it the ghetto, but they clearly have no idea what a ghetto is.
